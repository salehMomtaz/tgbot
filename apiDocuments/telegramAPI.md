**[See earlier changes »](https://core.telegram.org/bots/api-changelog)**

### [](#authorizing-your-bot)Authorizing your bot

Each bot is given a unique authentication token [when it is created](https://core.telegram.org/bots/features#botfather). The token looks something like `123456:ABC-DEF1234ghIkl-zyx57W2v1u123ew11`, but we'll use simply **<token>** in this document instead. You can learn about obtaining tokens and generating new ones in [this document](https://core.telegram.org/bots/features#botfather).

### [](#making-requests)Making requests

All queries to the Telegram Bot API must be served over HTTPS and need to be presented in this form: `https://api.telegram.org/bot<token>/METHOD_NAME`. Like this for example:

```
https://api.telegram.org/bot123456:ABC-DEF1234ghIkl-zyx57W2v1u123ew11/getMe
```


We support **GET** and **POST** HTTP methods. We support four ways of passing parameters in Bot API requests:

*   [URL query string](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Query_string)
*   application/x-www-form-urlencoded
*   application/json (except for uploading files)
*   multipart/form-data (use to upload files)

The response contains a JSON object, which always has a Boolean field 'ok' and may have an optional String field 'description' with a human-readable description of the result. If 'ok' equals _True_, the request was successful and the result of the query can be found in the 'result' field. In case of an unsuccessful request, 'ok' equals false and the error is explained in the 'description'. An Integer 'error\_code' field is also returned, but its contents are subject to change in the future. Some errors may also have an optional field 'parameters' of the type [ResponseParameters](#responseparameters), which can help to automatically handle the error.

*   All methods in the Bot API are case-insensitive.
*   All queries must be made using UTF-8.

#### [](#making-requests-when-getting-updates)Making requests when getting updates

If you're using [**webhooks**](#getting-updates), you can perform a request to the Bot API while sending an answer to the webhook. Use either _application/json_ or _application/x-www-form-urlencoded_ or _multipart/form-data_ response content type for passing parameters. Specify the method to be invoked in the _method_ parameter of the request. It's not possible to know that such a request was successful or get its result.

> Please see our [FAQ](https://core.telegram.org/bots/faq#how-can-i-make-requests-in-response-to-updates) for examples.

### [](#using-a-local-bot-api-server)Using a Local Bot API Server

The Bot API server source code is available at [telegram-bot-api](https://github.com/tdlib/telegram-bot-api). You can run it locally and send the requests to your own server instead of `https://api.telegram.org`. If you switch to a local Bot API server, your bot will be able to:

*   Download files without a size limit.
*   Upload files up to 2000 MB.
*   Upload files using their local path and [the file URI scheme](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File_URI_scheme).
*   Use an HTTP URL for the webhook.
*   Use any local IP address for the webhook.
*   Use any port for the webhook.
*   Set _max\_webhook\_connections_ up to 100000.
*   Receive the absolute local path as a value of the _file\_path_ field without the need to download the file after a [getFile](#getfile) request.

#### [](#do-i-need-a-local-bot-api-server)Do I need a Local Bot API Server

The majority of bots will be OK with the default configuration, running on our servers. But if you feel that you need one of [these features](#using-a-local-bot-api-server), you're welcome to switch to your own at any time.

### [](#getting-updates)Getting updates

There are two mutually exclusive ways of receiving updates for your bot - the [getUpdates](#getupdates) method on one hand and [webhooks](#setwebhook) on the other. Incoming updates are stored on the server until the bot receives them either way, but they will not be kept longer than 24 hours.

Regardless of which option you choose, you will receive JSON-serialized [Update](#update) objects as a result.

#### [](#update)Update

This [object](#available-types) represents an incoming update.  
At most **one** of the optional fields can be present in any given update.



* Field: update_id
  * Type: Integer
  * Description: The update's unique identifier. Update identifiers start from a certain positive number and increase sequentially. This identifier becomes especially handy if you're using webhooks, since it allows you to ignore repeated updates or to restore the correct update sequence, should they get out of order. If there are no new updates for at least a week, then identifier of the next update will be chosen randomly instead of sequentially.

If not specified, the previous setting will be used.Please note that this parameter doesn't affect updates created before the call to getUpdates, so unwanted updates may be received for a short period of time.


> **Notes**  
> **1.** This method will not work if an outgoing webhook is set up.  
> **2.** In order to avoid getting duplicate updates, recalculate _offset_ after each server response.

#### [](#setwebhook)setWebhook

Use this method to specify a URL and receive incoming updates via an outgoing webhook. Whenever there is an update for the bot, we will send an HTTPS POST request to the specified URL, containing a JSON-serialized [Update](#update). In case of an unsuccessful request (a request with response [HTTP status code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_HTTP_status_codes) different from `2XY`), we will repeat the request and give up after a reasonable amount of attempts. Returns _True_ on success.

If you'd like to make sure that the webhook was set by you, you can specify secret data in the parameter _secret\_token_. If specified, the request will contain a header “X-Telegram-Bot-Api-Secret-Token” with the secret token as content.

  * Description: A JSON-serialized list of the update types you want your bot to receive. For example, specify ["message", "edited_channel_post", "callback_query"] to only receive updates of these types. See Update for a complete list of available update types. Specify an empty list to receive all update types except chat_member, message_reaction, and message_reaction_count (default). If not specified, the previous setting will be used.Please note that this parameter doesn't affect updates created before the call to the setWebhook, so unwanted updates may be received for a short period of time.
* Parameter: drop_pending_updates
  * Type: Boolean
  * Required: Optional
  * Description: Pass True to drop all pending updates
* Parameter: secret_token
  * Type: String

* Field: input_field_placeholder
  * Type: String
  * Description: Optional. The placeholder to be shown in the input field when the reply is active; 1-64 characters
* Field: selective
  * Type: Boolean
  * Description: Optional. Use this parameter if you want to force reply from specific users only. Targets: 1) users that are @mentioned in the text of the Message object; 2) if the bot's message is a reply to a message in the same chat and forum topic, sender of the original message.


> **Example:** A [poll bot](https://t.me/PollBot) for groups runs in privacy mode (only receives commands, replies to its messages and mentions). There could be two ways to create a new poll:
> 
> *   Explain the user how to send a command with parameters (e.g. /newpoll question answer1 answer2). May be appealing for hardcore users but lacks modern day polish.
> *   Guide the user through a step-by-step process. 'Please send me your question', 'Cool, now let's add the first answer option', 'Great. Keep adding answer options, then send /done when you're ready'.
> 
> The last option is definitely more attractive. And if you use [ForceReply](#forcereply) in your bot's questions, it will receive the user's answers even if it only receives replies, commands and mentions - without any extra work for the user.

#### [](#sending-files)Sending files

There are three ways to send files (photos, stickers, audio, media, etc.):

1.  If the file is already stored somewhere on the Telegram servers, you don't need to reupload it: each file object has a **file\_id** field, simply pass this **file\_id** as a parameter instead of uploading. There are **no limits** for files sent this way.
2.  Provide Telegram with an HTTP URL for the file to be sent. Telegram will download and send the file. 5 MB max size for photos and 20 MB max for other types of content.
3.  Post the file using multipart/form-data in the usual way that files are uploaded via the browser. 10 MB max size for photos, 50 MB for other files.

**Sending by file\_id**

*   It is not possible to change the file type when resending by **file\_id**. I.e. a [video](#video) can't be [sent as a photo](#sendphoto), a [photo](#photosize) can't be [sent as a document](#senddocument), etc.
*   It is not possible to resend thumbnails.
*   Resending a photo by **file\_id** will send all of its [sizes](#photosize).
*   **file\_id** is unique for each individual bot and **can't** be transferred from one bot to another.
*   **file\_id** uniquely identifies a file, but a file can have different valid **file\_id**s even for the same bot.

**Sending by URL**

*   When sending by URL the target file must have the correct MIME type (e.g., audio/mpeg for [sendAudio](#sendaudio), etc.).
*   In [sendDocument](#senddocument), sending by URL will currently only work for **.PDF** and **.ZIP** files.
*   To use [sendVoice](#sendvoice), the file must have the type audio/ogg and be no more than 1MB in size. 1-20MB voice notes will be sent as files.
*   Other configurations may work but we can't guarantee that they will.

#### [](#formatting-options)Formatting options

The Bot API supports basic formatting for messages. You can use bold, italic, underlined, strikethrough, spoiler text, block quotations as well as inline links and pre-formatted code in your bots' messages. Telegram clients will render them accordingly. You can specify text entities directly, or use markdown-style or HTML-style formatting.

Note that Telegram clients will display an **alert** to the user before opening an inline link ('Open this link?' together with the full URL).

Message entities can be nested, providing following restrictions are met:  
\- If two entities have common characters, then one of them is fully contained inside another.  
\- _bold_, _italic_, _underline_, _strikethrough_, and _spoiler_ entities can contain and can be part of any other entities, except _pre_ and _code_.  
\- _blockquote_ and _expandable\_blockquote_ entities can't be nested.  
\- All other entities can't contain each other.

Links `tg://user?id=<user_id>` can be used to mention a user by their identifier without using a username. Please note:

*   These links will work **only** if they are used inside an inline link or in an inline keyboard button. For example, they will not work, when used in a message text.
*   Unless the user is a member of the chat where they were mentioned, these mentions are only guaranteed to work if the user has contacted the bot in private in the past or has sent a callback query to the bot via an inline button and doesn't have Forwarded Messages privacy enabled for the bot.

You can find the list of programming and markup languages for which syntax highlighting is supported at [libprisma#supported-languages](https://github.com/TelegramMessenger/libprisma#supported-languages).

###### [](#date-time-entity-formatting)Date-time entity formatting

Date-time entity formatting is specified by a format string, which must adhere to the following regular expression: `r|w?[dD]?[tT]?`.

If the format string is empty, the underlying text is displayed as-is; however, the user can still receive the underlying date in their local format. When populated, the format string determines the output based on the presence of the following control characters:

*   **`r`**: Displays the time relative to the current time. Cannot be combined with any other control characters.
*   **`w`**: Displays the day of the week in the user's localized language.
*   **`d`**: Displays the date in short form (e.g., “17.03.22”).
*   **`D`**: Displays the date in long form (e.g., “March 17, 2022”).
*   **`t`**: Displays the time in short form (e.g., “22:45”).
*   **`T`**: Displays the time in long form (e.g., “22:45:00”).

###### [](#markdownv2-style)MarkdownV2 style

To use this mode, pass _MarkdownV2_ in the _parse\_mode_ field. Use the following syntax in your message:

```
*bold \*text*
_italic \*text_
__underline__
~strikethrough~
||spoiler||
*bold _italic bold ~italic bold strikethrough ||italic bold strikethrough spoiler||~ __underline italic bold___ bold*
[inline URL](http://www.example.com/)

`inline fixed-width code`
```
pre-formatted fixed-width code block
```
```python
pre-formatted fixed-width code block written in the Python programming language
```
>Block quotation started
>Block quotation continued
>Block quotation continued
>Block quotation continued
>The last line of the block quotation
**>The expandable block quotation started right after the previous block quotation
>It is separated from the previous block quotation by an empty bold entity
>Expandable block quotation continued
>Hidden by default part of the expandable block quotation started
>Expandable block quotation continued
>The last line of the expandable block quotation with the expandability mark||
```


Please note:

*   Any character with code between 1 and 126 inclusively can be escaped anywhere with a preceding '\\' character, in which case it is treated as an ordinary character and not a part of the markup. This implies that '\\' character usually must be escaped with a preceding '\\' character.
*   Inside `pre` and `code` entities, all '\`' and '\\' characters must be escaped with a preceding '\\' character.
*   Inside the `(...)` part of the inline link and custom emoji definition, all ')' and '\\' must be escaped with a preceding '\\' character.
*   In all other places characters '\_', '\*', '\[', '\]', '(', ')', '~', '\`', '>', '#', '+', '-', '=', '|', '{', '}', '.', '!' must be escaped with the preceding character '\\'.
*   In case of ambiguity between `italic` and `underline` entities `__` is always greedily treated from left to right as beginning or end of an `underline` entity, so instead of `___italic underline___` use `___italic underline_**__`, adding an empty bold entity as a separator.
*   A valid emoji must be provided as an alternative value for the custom emoji. The emoji will be shown instead of the custom emoji in places where a custom emoji cannot be displayed (e.g., system notifications) or if the message is forwarded by a non-premium user. It is recommended to use the emoji from the **emoji** field of the custom emoji [sticker](#sticker).
*   Custom emoji entities can only be used by bots that purchased additional usernames on [Fragment](https://fragment.com) or in the messages directly sent by the bot to private, group and supergroup chats if the owner of the bot has a Telegram Premium subscription.
*   See [date-time entity formatting](#date-time-entity-formatting) for more details about supported date-time formats.

###### [](#html-style)HTML style

To use this mode, pass _HTML_ in the _parse\_mode_ field. The following tags are currently supported:

<blockquote expandable>Expandable block quotation started\nExpandable block quotation continued\nExpandable block quotation continued\nHidden by default part of the block quotation started\nExpandable block quotation continued\nThe last line of the block quotation</blockquote>
```


Please note:

*   Only the tags mentioned above are currently supported.
*   All `<`, `>` and `&` symbols that are not a part of a tag or an HTML entity must be replaced with the corresponding HTML entities (`<` with `&lt;`, `>` with `&gt;` and `&` with `&amp;`).
*   All numerical HTML entities are supported.
*   The API currently supports only the following named HTML entities: `&lt;`, `&gt;`, `&amp;` and `&quot;`.
*   Use nested `pre` and `code` tags, to define programming language for `pre` entity.
*   Programming language can't be specified for standalone `code` tags.
*   A valid emoji must be used as the content of the `tg-emoji` tag. The emoji will be shown instead of the custom emoji in places where a custom emoji cannot be displayed (e.g., system notifications) or if the message is forwarded by a non-premium user. It is recommended to use the emoji from the **emoji** field of the custom emoji [sticker](#sticker).
*   Custom emoji entities can only be used by bots that purchased additional usernames on [Fragment](https://fragment.com) or in the messages directly sent by the bot to private, group and supergroup chats if the owner of the bot has a Telegram Premium subscription.
*   See [date-time entity formatting](#date-time-entity-formatting) for more details about supported date-time formats.

###### [](#markdown-style)Markdown style

This is a legacy mode, retained for backward compatibility. To use this mode, pass _Markdown_ in the _parse\_mode_ field. Use the following syntax in your message:

```
*bold text*
_italic text_
[inline URL](http://www.example.com/)
[inline mention of a user](tg://user?id=123456789)
`inline fixed-width code`
```
pre-formatted fixed-width code block
```
```python
pre-formatted fixed-width code block written in the Python programming language
```
```


Please note:

*   Entities must not be nested, use parse mode [MarkdownV2](#markdownv2-style) instead.
*   There is no way to specify “underline”, “strikethrough”, “spoiler”, “blockquote”, “expandable\_blockquote”, “custom\_emoji”, and “date\_time” entities, use parse mode [MarkdownV2](#markdownv2-style) instead.
*   To escape characters '\_', '\*', '\`', '\[' outside of an entity, prepend the character '\\' before them.
*   Escaping inside entities is not allowed, so entity must be closed first and reopened again: use `_snake_\__case_` for italic `snake_case` and `*2*\**2=4*` for bold `2*2=4`.

#### [](#paid-broadcasts)Paid Broadcasts

By default, all bots are able to broadcast up to [30 messages](https://core.telegram.org/bots/faq#my-bot-is-hitting-limits-how-do-i-avoid-this) per second to their users. Developers can increase this limit by enabling _Paid Broadcasts_ in [@BotFather](https://t.me/botfather) - allowing their bot to broadcast **up to 1000 messages** per second.

Each message broadcasted over the free amount of 30 messages per second incurs a cost of 0.1 Stars per message, paid with Telegram Stars from the bot's balance. In order to use this feature, a bot must have at least _10,000 Stars_ on its balance.

> Bots with increased limits are only charged for messages that are broadcasted successfully.

Use this if the data submitted by the user doesn't satisfy the standards your service requires for any reason. For example, if a birthday date seems invalid, a submitted document is blurry, a scan shows evidence of tampering, etc. Supply some details in the error message to make sure the user knows how to correct the issues.

### [](#games)Games

Your bot can offer users **HTML5 games** to play solo or to compete against each other in groups and one-on-one chats. Create games via [@BotFather](https://t.me/botfather) using the _/newgame_ command. Please note that this kind of power requires responsibility: you will need to accept the terms for each game that your bots will be offering.

*   Games are a new type of content on Telegram, represented by the [Game](#game) and [InlineQueryResultGame](#inlinequeryresultgame) objects.
*   Once you've created a game via [BotFather](https://t.me/botfather), you can send games to chats as regular messages using the [sendGame](#sendgame) method, or use [inline mode](#inline-mode) with [InlineQueryResultGame](#inlinequeryresultgame).
*   If you send the game message without any buttons, it will automatically have a 'Play _GameName_' button. When this button is pressed, your bot gets a [CallbackQuery](#callbackquery) with the _game\_short\_name_ of the requested game. You provide the correct URL for this particular user and the app opens the game in the in-app browser.
*   You can manually add multiple buttons to your game message. Please note that the first button in the first row **must always** launch the game, using the field _callback\_game_ in [InlineKeyboardButton](#inlinekeyboardbutton). You can add extra buttons according to taste: e.g., for a description of the rules, or to open the game's official community.
*   To make your game more attractive, you can upload a GIF animation that demonstrates the game to the users via [BotFather](https://t.me/botfather) (see [Lumberjack](https://t.me/gamebot?game=lumberjack) for example).
*   A game message will also display high scores for the current chat. Use [setGameScore](#setgamescore) to post high scores to the chat with the game, add the _disable\_edit\_message_ parameter to disable automatic update of the message with the current scoreboard.
*   Use [getGameHighScores](#getgamehighscores) to get data for in-game high score tables.
*   You can also add an extra [sharing button](https://core.telegram.org/bots/games#sharing-your-game-to-telegram-chats) for users to share their best score to different chats.
*   For examples of what can be done using this new stuff, check the [@gamebot](https://t.me/gamebot) and [@gamee](https://t.me/gamee) bots.
